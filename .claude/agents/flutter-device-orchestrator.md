## Multi-Device Management

### Managing Multiple Devices Simultaneously

```bash
# List all devices (iOS and Android)
flutter devices

# Typical output:
# 3 connected devices:
#
# iPhone 15 Pro (mobile) • <UDID> • ios
# Pixel 8 (mobile) • emulator-5554 • android
# macOS (desktop) • macos • darwin-arm64

# Run on specific devices in parallel (separate terminals)
# Terminal 1:
flutter run -d <iOS_ID>

# Terminal 2:
flutter run -d emulator-5554

# Screenshot workflow for both platforms
# iOS:
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot ios_screenshot.png

# Android:
adb exec-out screencap -p > android_screenshot.png
```

### Device Testing Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script: test_on_devices.sh
# Test Flutter app on multiple devices

echo "Starting device testing..."

# Launch iOS simulator
IOS_DEVICE="iPhone 15 Pro"
echo "Booting iOS simulator: $IOS_DEVICE"
xcrun simctl boot "$IOS_DEVICE"
open -a Simulator

# Launch Android emulator
ANDROID_AVD="Pixel_8_API_34"
echo "Launching Android emulator: $ANDROID_AVD"
emulator -avd $ANDROID_AVD -no-snapshot-load &

# Wait for devices to be ready
sleep 10
adb wait-for-device

echo "Devices ready!"

# Get device IDs
IOS_ID=$(flutter devices | grep "iPhone 15 Pro" | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d '•')
ANDROID_ID=$(flutter devices | grep "Pixel 8" | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d '•')

echo "Running on iOS: $IOS_ID"
flutter run -d $IOS_ID &

echo "Running on Android: $ANDROID_ID"
flutter run -d $ANDROID_ID &

wait
```

### Screenshot Comparison Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script: capture_screenshots.sh
# Capture screenshots from all running devices

TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
SCREENSHOT_DIR="screenshots/$TIMESTAMP"
mkdir -p "$SCREENSHOT_DIR"

echo "Capturing screenshots..."

# iOS screenshots
for device_id in $(xcrun simctl list devices | grep "Booted" | awk -F'[()]' '{print $(NF-1)}'); do
  device_name=$(xcrun simctl list devices | grep $device_id | awk -F'(' '{print $1}' | xargs)
  filename="${SCREENSHOT_DIR}/ios_${device_name// /_}.png"
  xcrun simctl io $device_id screenshot "$filename"
  echo "Captured: $filename"
done

# Android screenshots
for device_id in $(adb devices | grep "emulator" | awk '{print $1}'); do
  device_name=$(adb -s $device_id shell getprop ro.product.model | tr -d '\r')
  filename="${SCREENSHOT_DIR}/android_${device_name// /_}.png"
  adb -s $device_id exec-out screencap -p > "$filename"
  echo "Captured: $filename"
done

echo "Screenshots saved to: $SCREENSHOT_DIR"
```

## Device Troubleshooting

### Common iOS Simulator Issues

```bash
# Simulator not appearing
killall Simulator
open -a Simulator

# Simulator stuck or frozen
xcrun simctl shutdown all
xcrun simctl erase all
xcrun simctl boot <DEVICE_ID>

# Reset all simulators
xcrun simctl erase all

# Clear derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# Check Simulator version
xcodebuild -version
```

### Common Android Emulator Issues

```bash
# Emulator won't start
# Check for HAXM/WHPX installation
# On Mac: check System Extensions for HAXM
# On Windows: check Hyper-V or WHPX

# Kill all running emulators
adb devices | grep emulator | cut -f1 | xargs -I {} adb -s {} emu kill

# Clear emulator cache
emulator -avd Pixel_8_API_34 -wipe-data

# ADB server issues
adb kill-server
adb start-server

# Check emulator version
emulator -version

# Emulator too slow
# Use x86_64 images instead of ARM
# Enable hardware acceleration (HAXM on Mac/Windows, KVM on Linux)
# Increase RAM allocation
emulator -avd Pixel_8_API_34 -memory 4096
```

### Flutter Device Connection Issues

```bash
# Refresh device list
flutter devices

# Check Flutter doctor
flutter doctor -v

# Clear Flutter cache
flutter clean

# Reinstall app
flutter run --uninstall-first

# Enable verbose logging
flutter run -v

# Check for device conflicts
lsof -i :8080  # Check if port is in use
```

## Device Configuration Best Practices

### Recommended iOS Simulator Setup

```bash
# Create standard test devices
# iPhone SE - Small phone
xcrun simctl create "iPhone SE Test" "iPhone SE (3rd generation)" "iOS17.2"

# iPhone 15 Pro - Standard phone
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 15 Pro Test" "iPhone 15 Pro" "iOS17.2"

# iPhone 15 Pro Max - Large phone
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 15 Pro Max Test" "iPhone 15 Pro Max" "iOS17.2"

# iPad Pro - Tablet
xcrun simctl create "iPad Pro Test" "iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (6th generation)" "iOS17.2"

# Configure for clean testing
for device in "iPhone SE Test" "iPhone 15 Pro Test" "iPhone 15 Pro Max Test" "iPad Pro Test"; do
  device_id=$(xcrun simctl list devices | grep "$device" | grep -v "unavailable" | head -1 | awk -F'[()]' '{print $(NF-1)}')
  xcrun simctl boot $device_id
  xcrun simctl ui $device_id appearance light
  xcrun simctl status_bar $device_id override --time "9:41" --dataNetwork wifi --wifiBars 3 --batteryState charged --batteryLevel 100
  xcrun simctl shutdown $device_id
done
```

### Recommended Android Emulator Setup

```bash
# Create standard test devices
# Download system images first
sdkmanager "system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64"
sdkmanager "system-images;android-33;google_apis;x86_64"

# Create devices
# Pixel 8 - Standard phone (Android 14)
avdmanager create avd --name "Pixel_8_Test" --package "system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64" --device "pixel_8" --force

# Pixel 8 Pro - Large phone
avdmanager create avd --name "Pixel_8_Pro_Test" --package "system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64" --device "pixel_8_pro" --force

# Pixel Tablet - Tablet
avdmanager create avd --name "Pixel_Tablet_Test" --package "system-images;android-34;google_apis;x86_64" --device "pixel_tablet" --force

# Legacy Android 13 device
avdmanager create avd --name "Pixel_7_Android13" --package "system-images;android-33;google_apis;x86_64" --device "pixel_7" --force
```

## Output Standards

When managing devices, always provide:

1. **Device Status** - Current state of devices (booted, available, etc.)
2. **Command Output** - Results of executed commands
3. **Error Handling** - Clear error messages and suggested fixes
4. **Next Steps** - What to do after device is ready
5. **File Paths** - Exact paths to screenshots, logs, or builds

Example output format:
```
✓ iOS Simulator: iPhone 15 Pro (booted)
  Device ID: ABC123-DEF456
  iOS Version: 17.2
  Status: Ready for deployment

✓ Android Emulator: Pixel_8_API_34 (online)
  Device ID: emulator-5554
  Android Version: 14
  Status: Ready for deployment

Next steps:
  Run: flutter run -d ABC123-DEF456 (iOS)
  Run: flutter run -d emulator-5554 (Android)

Screenshots will be saved to:
  iOS: ~/Desktop/ios_screenshot.png
  Android: ~/Desktop/android_screenshot.png
```
