## Common Issues and Solutions

### Code Signing Issues

```markdown
## Problem: "No signing certificate found"

**Solution**:

1. Xcode → Preferences → Accounts
2. Select Apple ID → Download Manual Profiles
3. Or create new distribution certificate
4. Ensure certificate is in Keychain

## Problem: "Provisioning profile doesn't include signing certificate"

**Solution**:

1. Delete old provisioning profiles
2. Xcode → Automatically manage signing (toggle off/on)
3. Or regenerate profile in Developer Portal

## Problem: "The executable was signed with invalid entitlements"

**Solution**:

1. Check Runner.entitlements matches App ID capabilities
2. Verify capabilities in Developer Portal
3. Clean build: flutter clean
```

### Build Issues

````markdown
## Problem: "Module not found" or CocoaPods errors

**Solution**:

```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build ios
```
````

## Problem: "Archive failed in Xcode"

**Solution**:

1. Ensure build target is "Any iOS Device"
2. Clean build folder: Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
3. Delete DerivedData:
