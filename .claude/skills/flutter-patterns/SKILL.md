# Flutter Patterns

A comprehensive collection of battle-tested Flutter patterns and best practices for building production-quality applications.

## Overview

This skill provides quick-reference patterns for:
- **Widget Patterns**: Common UI components (cards, lists, forms, dialogs, navigation)
- **Testing Patterns**: Unit, widget, and integration testing approaches
- **Performance Patterns**: Optimization techniques and performance checklists
- **Security Patterns**: Security best practices and vulnerability prevention
- **Animation Patterns**: Common animation implementations and transitions

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need:
- Quick reference for standard Flutter UI patterns
- Testing strategy guidance and examples
- Performance optimization checklists
- Security vulnerability prevention
- Animation implementation examples
- Best practices for common Flutter development scenarios

## Pattern Categories

### Widget Patterns
See [patterns/flutter-widget-patterns.md](patterns/flutter-widget-patterns.md) for:
- Card patterns (basic, image, custom)
- List patterns (lazy loading, sectioned)
- Form patterns with validation
- Dialog and bottom sheet patterns
- Loading and empty states
- Navigation patterns
- Responsive layouts

### Testing Patterns
See [patterns/flutter-testing-patterns.md](patterns/flutter-testing-patterns.md) for:
- Unit test structure and best practices
- Widget testing approaches
- Integration test patterns
- Mock and stub strategies
- Test organization and naming conventions
- Coverage best practices

### Performance Patterns
See [patterns/flutter-performance-checklist.md](patterns/flutter-performance-checklist.md) for:
- Build method optimization
- Widget rebuilding minimization
- List and grid performance
- Image loading optimization
- Memory leak prevention
- Rendering performance tips

### Security Patterns
See [patterns/flutter-security-patterns.md](patterns/flutter-security-patterns.md) for:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure storage practices
- API security best practices
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Data encryption approaches
- Common vulnerability prevention (XSS, injection, etc.)

### Animation Patterns
See [patterns/flutter-animation-patterns.md](patterns/flutter-animation-patterns.md) for:
- Basic animation controllers
- Tween animations
- Hero animations
- Page transitions
- Implicit animations
- Physics-based animations
- Custom animation patterns

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Need a card UI pattern**
```
User: "I need to create a product card with an image and details"
→ Reference Widget Patterns for image card implementation
```

**Example 2: Writing tests**
```
User: "How should I structure my widget tests?"
→ Reference Testing Patterns for widget test examples
```

**Example 3: Performance issues**
```
User: "My list is laggy when scrolling"
→ Reference Performance Patterns for list optimization techniques
```

**Example 4: Security concern**
```
User: "How do I securely store user credentials?"
→ Reference Security Patterns for secure storage approaches
```

**Example 5: Adding animations**
```
User: "I want to animate a page transition"
→ Reference Animation Patterns for page transition examples
```

## Pattern Quality

All patterns in this skill are:
- ✓ Production-tested and battle-proven
- ✓ Following Flutter best practices
- ✓ Performance-optimized
- ✓ Security-conscious
- ✓ Well-documented with code examples

## Quick Access

For fast pattern lookup, each category file is self-contained with:
- Complete, runnable code examples
- Explanation of when to use each pattern
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Performance and security considerations

---

**Pro tip**: Combine patterns from different categories for comprehensive solutions. For example, use Widget Patterns + Performance Patterns + Security Patterns together when building production features.
