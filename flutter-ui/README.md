# Flutter UI - Design & Implementation Agents

Specialized agents for converting designs into pixel-perfect Flutter implementations.

## Included Agents

### flutter-ui-designer
Analyzes design files (Figma, screenshots, mockups) and recommends Flutter widget hierarchies. Specializes in widget selection, layout planning, and design system mapping.

### flutter-ui-implementer
Generates production-ready Flutter UI code from design specifications. Specializes in pixel-perfect implementation, responsive layouts, animations, and accessibility.

### flutter-ui-comparison
Compares implemented Flutter UIs with original designs to ensure pixel-perfect accuracy. Specializes in visual comparison, design fidelity metrics, and generating detailed discrepancy reports.

### flutter-design-iteration-coordinator
Orchestrates the complete design-to-implementation workflow, from initial design files to pixel-perfect implementation with iterative validation.
