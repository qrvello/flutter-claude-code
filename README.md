## Primary Workflows

### 1. Design-to-Implementation (Core Workflow)

```
Design Input → UI Designer → UI Implementer → Device Orchestrator →
UI Comparison → Design Iteration Coordinator → Pixel-Perfect Implementation
```

**Capabilities:**
- Analyze Figma designs or screenshots
- Generate Flutter widget hierarchies
- Implement with exact styling
- Launch on iOS simulators and Android emulators
- Compare implementation with original design
- Iterate until pixel-perfect (>95% fidelity)

### 2. Complete Development Lifecycle

```
Design → Architecture → Implementation → Backend Integration →
Performance Optimization → Testing → Deployment
```

**Capabilities:**
- Set up Clean Architecture project structure
- Implement state management (Provider, BLoC, Riverpod)
- Integrate iOS/Android native features
- Connect to REST APIs, Firebase, AWS, GraphQL
- Profile and optimize performance
- Write comprehensive tests
- Deploy to App Store and Play Store

## Documentation Foundation

All agents are grounded in the official Flutter documentation at https://docs.flutter.dev, covering:

- **UI Development**: /ui/widgets, /ui/layout, /ui/animations, /ui/design/material
- **Platform Integration**: /platform-integration/ios, /platform-integration/android, /platform-integration/platform-channels
- **State & Data**: /data-and-backend/state-mgmt, /data-and-backend/networking, /data-and-backend/firebase
- **Performance**: /perf, /perf/rendering-performance, /tools/devtools
- **Testing**: /testing/overview, /testing/debugging
- **Deployment**: /deployment/android, /deployment/ios
- **Architecture**: /resources/architectural-overview, /get-started/fundamentals

## Key Features

### Design Fidelity
- Pixel-perfect accuracy (>95% fidelity)
- Automated comparison between design and implementation
- Iterative refinement process
- Support for Figma, screenshots, and mockups

### Platform Parity
- Consistent features across iOS and Android
- Platform-specific native integrations when needed
- Proper Material Design (Android) and Cupertino (iOS) implementations
- Platform channel support for native code

### Backend Flexibility

- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Example: Design to Implementation

```
1. Export your design from Figma as PNG
2. Save to /designs/screen_name.png
3. Ask flutter-design-iteration-coordinator:
   "Create a pixel-perfect implementation of /designs/screen_name.png"
4. Agent orchestrates the complete workflow
5. Receive pixel-perfect Flutter code
```

### Example: New Project Setup

```
1. Ask flutter-architect:
   "Create a new e-commerce app with Clean Architecture"
2. Receive complete project structure
3. Ask flutter-state-management:
   "Set up BLoC for state management"
4. Receive configured state management
```

### Example: Firebase Integration

```
1. Ask flutter-firebase:
   "Set up Firebase Auth and Firestore for user profiles"
2. Receive complete Firebase integration
3. Get authentication service and Firestore service
```

## Success Metrics

The system tracks effectiveness through:

- **Design Fidelity**: Percentage match between design and implementation
- **Iteration Efficiency**: Number of iterations to achieve pixel-perfect result
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability score, test coverage
- **Performance**: Frame rendering, memory usage, app size
- **Deployment Success**: App store approval rate, deployment time

## Available Skills

The `flutter-patterns` skill provides on-demand reference for:

1. **Widget Patterns**: Common widget compositions and best practices
2. **Animation Patterns**: Reusable animation implementations
3. **Testing Patterns**: Test templates and strategies
4. **Performance Patterns**: Optimization techniques
5. **Security Patterns**: Security best practices

## Agent Interaction Matrix

Agents are designed to work together:

- **flutter-design-iteration-coordinator** orchestrates flutter-ui-designer, flutter-ui-implementer, flutter-device-orchestrator, and flutter-ui-comparison
- **flutter-architect** works with flutter-state-management
- **flutter-platform-channel-architect** coordinates with flutter-ios-integration and flutter-android-integration
- **flutter-performance-analyzer** feeds findings to flutter-performance-optimizer
- **flutter-ios-deployment** and **flutter-android-deployment** work in parallel
