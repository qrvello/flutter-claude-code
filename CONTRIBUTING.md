## Quick Start for Contributors

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have access to the `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` directories
3. The plugin directories use symlinks to avoid duplication

### File Structure

```
flutter-claude-code/
├── .claude/                          # Source of truth
│   ├── agents/                       # All 19 agent definitions
│   └── skills/                       # All skills
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── marketplace.json              # Plugin marketplace config
├── flutter-all/                      # Complete suite
│   ├── agents -> ../../.claude/agents  (symlink)
│   └── skills/
│       └── flutter-patterns -> ...    (symlink)
├── flutter-ui/                       # UI category
│   └── agents/                       # Symlinks to specific agents
├── flutter-testing-performance/
├── flutter-architecture/
├── flutter-platform/
├── flutter-backend/
├── flutter-deployment/
└── flutter-patterns/
```

**Important**: Agent files in `.claude/agents/` are the source of truth. Plugin directories contain symlinks to these files.

## Detailed Architecture Documentation

For complete architecture details, see the original documentation files:
- `FLUTTER_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` - Complete specification
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Implementation instructions
- `WORKFLOW_DIAGRAMS.md` - Visual workflows

---

## Implementation Guide

### Creating or Modifying Agents

1. **Edit source files** in `.claude/agents/`
2. **Test thoroughly** with real Flutter projects
3. **Update documentation** if changing agent behavior
4. **Submit pull request** with description of changes

### Agent Structure

Each agent should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Agent Name

## Purpose
Brief description of what this agent does

## Responsibilities
- Specific task 1
- Specific task 2
- etc.

## Expertise Areas
- Knowledge domain 1
- Knowledge domain 2
- etc.

## Usage Examples
Examples of when to use this agent

## Tools Required
- Tool 1
- Tool 2
- etc.
```

### Testing Agents

Before submitting changes:
1. Test with multiple Flutter projects
2. Verify agent works in isolation
3. Test agent coordination with related agents
4. Check documentation accuracy

---

## Workflow Patterns

### Design-to-Implementation Workflow

```
Design Input → UI Designer → UI Implementer → Device Orchestrator →
UI Comparison → Design Iteration Coordinator → Pixel-Perfect Implementation
```

**Success Criteria**: Fidelity score >95%

### Complete Development Lifecycle

```
Design → Architecture → Implementation → Backend Integration →
Performance Optimization → Testing → Deployment
```

### Platform Integration Workflow

```
Native Feature Needed → Platform Channel Architect →
iOS/Android Integration Specialists → Native Code Implementation
```

For detailed workflow diagrams, see `WORKFLOW_DIAGRAMS.md`.

## Adding New Agents

To add a new agent:

1. **Identify the need**: What gap does this agent fill?
2. **Define responsibilities**: What will this agent do?
3. **Create agent file** in `.claude/agents/new-agent.md`
4. **Add to appropriate plugin**: Create symlink in relevant plugin directory
5. **Update marketplace**: Add to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` if needed
6. **Document usage**: Add examples to `AGENT_USAGE_SCENARIOS.md`
7. **Test thoroughly**: Verify agent works as expected

### Agent vs Skill Decision

**Create as Agent when:**
- Requires multi-step workflows
- Needs tool usage (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
- Requires orchestration between operations
- Maintains context across interactions

**Create as Skill when:**
- Provides reusable patterns/templates
- Represents best practices reference
- Offers on-demand knowledge
- Augments other agents

## Plugin Development

### Creating a New Plugin Category

1. Create plugin directory: `mkdir flutter-new-category`
2. Create `.claude-plugin/` subdirectory
3. Add `plugin.json` with metadata
4. Create `agents/` directory
5. Add symlinks to relevant agents from `.claude/agents/`
6. Add plugin to marketplace.json
7. Create README.md for the plugin

### Plugin Metadata (plugin.json)

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name",
  "description": "Brief description of what this plugin provides",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": {
    "name": "Flutter Claude Code Contributors"
  }
}
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### When to Update Documentation

- Adding new agents → Update `AGENT_USAGE_SCENARIOS.md`
- Changing architecture → Update this file
- Modifying workflows → Update `WORKFLOW_DIAGRAMS.md`
- Plugin changes → Update `PLUGIN_INSTALLATION.md`

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Provide practical examples
- Include code samples when relevant
- Keep consistent formatting

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Agent Definition Quality

- Clear, focused purpose
- Well-defined responsibilities
- Comprehensive expertise areas
- Practical usage examples

### Testing Standards

- Test with multiple Flutter versions
- Verify cross-platform behavior
- Check edge cases
- Validate error handling

---

## Release Process

1. Update version in relevant `plugin.json` files
2. Update CHANGELOG (if exists)
3. Test all plugins
4. Tag release in git
5. Update documentation

---
