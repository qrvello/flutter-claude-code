# Flutter Claude Code Plugin Installation Guide

This repository provides specialized Flutter development agents and skills for Claude Code, organized as modular plugins that you can install individually or as a complete suite.

## Quick Start

### Install Everything (Recommended for Most Users)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/flutter-claude-code
/plugin install flutter-all@flutter-claude-code
```

This installs all 19 agents and the comprehensive patterns skill.

### Install Specific Categories

If you only need specific functionality, install individual plugin categories:

#### UI & Design
```bash
/plugin install flutter-ui@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-ui-designer` - Analyze designs and recommend Flutter widgets
- `flutter-ui-implementer` - Generate production-ready Flutter UI code
- `flutter-ui-comparison` - Compare implementation with designs for pixel-perfect accuracy
- `flutter-design-iteration-coordinator` - Complete design-to-implementation workflow

#### Testing & Performance
```bash
/plugin install flutter-testing-performance@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-testing` - Write unit, widget, and integration tests
- `flutter-performance-analyzer` - Profile and identify performance bottlenecks
- `flutter-performance-optimizer` - Apply performance optimization patterns

#### Architecture & State Management
```bash
/plugin install flutter-architecture@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-bloc` - BLoC pattern state management with Cubit, flutter_bloc widgets, testing, and persistence
- `flutter-architect` - Clean Architecture, project structure, dependency injection

#### Platform Integration
```bash
/plugin install flutter-platform@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-ios-integration` - iOS-specific features and Swift/Objective-C integration
- `flutter-android-integration` - Android-specific features and Kotlin/Java integration
- `flutter-platform-channel-architect` - Cross-platform communication architecture
- `flutter-device-orchestrator` - iOS simulator and Android emulator management

#### Backend Integration
```bash
/plugin install flutter-backend@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-rest-api` - REST API integration with Dio
- `flutter-graphql` - GraphQL with graphql_flutter
- `flutter-firebase` - Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, FCM, Analytics
- `flutter-aws` - AWS Amplify, Cognito, S3, AppSync

#### Deployment
```bash
/plugin install flutter-deployment@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-ios-deployment` - App Store deployment, TestFlight, code signing
- `flutter-android-deployment` - Google Play deployment, app signing

#### Patterns & Best Practices
```bash
/plugin install flutter-patterns@flutter-claude-code
```
**Includes:**
- `flutter-patterns` skill - Comprehensive patterns for widgets, testing, performance, security, and animations

## Using the Agents

After installation, agents are available via the Task tool. Example:

```
I need to implement a login screen from this Figma design
```

Claude Code will automatically use the `flutter-ui-designer` agent to analyze the design, then `flutter-ui-implementer` to generate code.

You can also explicitly request specific agents:

```
Use the flutter-bloc agent to help me implement BLoC for authentication
```

## Using the Skill

The `flutter-patterns` skill provides quick reference for Flutter best practices:

```
/flutter-patterns
```

This loads comprehensive patterns covering:
- Widget patterns (StatefulWidget, StatelessWidget, InheritedWidget, etc.)
- Testing patterns (unit, widget, integration, BLoC testing, mocking)
- Performance patterns (const constructors, keys, builders, RepaintBoundary)
- Security patterns (secure storage, API keys, SSL pinning, authentication)
- Animation patterns (AnimationController, Tween, Hero, implicit animations)
